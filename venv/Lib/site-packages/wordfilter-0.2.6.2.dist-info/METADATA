wordfilter
==========

A small module meant for use in text generators that lets you filter
strings for bad words.

Getting Started
---------------

Install the module with ``pip install wordfilter``

.. code:: python

    > import wordfilter
    > wordfilter.blacklisted("does this string have a bad word in it?")
    False

    # add new words
    > wordfilter.add_words(["zebra", "elephant"])
    > wordfilter.blacklisted("this string has zebra in it")
    True

    # remove a word
    > wordfilter.remove_words('zebra')
    > wordfilter.blacklisted('this string has zebra in it')
    False

    # clear the list entirely
    > wordfilter.clear_list()

Documentation
-------------

This is a word filter adapted from code that I use in a lot of my
twitter bots. It is based on `a list of words that I've
hand-picked <https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter/blob/master/lib/badwords.json>`__
for exclusion from my bots: essentially, it's a list of things that I
would not say myself. Generally speaking, they are "words of
oppression", aka racist/sexist/ableist things that I would not say.

The list is not all-inclusive, and I'm always adding words to it. If
you'd like to file an issue or a pull request to add more words, please
do so, but understand that this is primarily for use in my own projects,
and I may not agree to add certain words. (For example, I have no
problem with scatological words, so "shit" and "fuck" will never be on
this list.)

Words are case insensitive.

Also note that due to the complexities of the English language, I am
considering anything containing the substring of a bad word to be
blacklisted. For example, even though "homogenous" is not a bad word, it
contains the substring "homo" and it gets filtered. The reason for this
is that new slang pops up all the time using compound words and I can't
possibly keep up with it. I'm willing to lose a few words like
"homogenous" and "Pakistan" in order to avoid false negatives.

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing
coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint
and test your code using `Grunt <http://gruntjs.com/>`__.
